The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!\"},\n",

She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\\r\\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\\r\\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would totally stay here again.  \"},\n",

Birds singing in the trees outside, comfy beds, loads of restaurants and grocery nearby. Lovely easy walks to Central Park, Riverside Park. Subway stop right on the corner. We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. \"},\n",

Sogar eine Bar im Untergeschoss, für die die nicht weit gehen wollen. Ansonsten ist eigentlich alles gleich um die Ecke (Einkaufszentrum, Restaurants, Hilton Village, Strand...) Man hat vom 12.

We were able to get around pretty easily by just walking, which was nice because parking in Waikiki can be a nightmare. Speaking of parking, Dana was very helpful in telling us where we could find it. The unit was exactly what we were looking for, a clean place to crash after a day out and about. The one quirk is that there is no actual door to the bathroom.

The building itself is old, but the room is in good shape. The distance is convenient for anything Waikiki. As for parking a car, good luck trying to find parking in this area, if you can't then you'll have to cough up $25 for a overnight car stay. Laundry is available in the building and there's a couple of bars downstairs. I recommend this place to anyone staying in Waikiki while saving some budget to allocate towards eating and activities.\"},\n",

The huge windows had a nice view of the ocean in the distance and allowed for an amazing cross breeze.  I think it was a heatwave when we were there, so the window AC unit was also much appreciated.

The front desk was very helpful with our touristy questions like bus services and destinations. Great location if you're going to Hanauma Bay as it is just blocks from the start of the #22 bus which takes you right there for $2.50! Dana was a great host. Super friendly, prompt,  answered all of our questions and made great recommendations. Studio is clean and has a laundry room in the building. Definitely sufficient for two people. Only thing that would have made it a perfect stay was how bright it got in the morning. For most people, that's a huge plus, and it is for us too... usually. But sometimes when you've been up for hours flying, you just want to crash and wake up on your own and without the help of the sun haha. But! That can be easily solved with a pair of those $3 eye cover things. But bring your own! I looked high and low all over Waikiki and couldn't find a pair! Bottom line, would stay here again and recommend. Convenient, clean, affordable and no frills, just the necessities. \"},\n",

       "   'comments': \"I stayed at Dana's space with my husband for one night in October -- what a special find! \\n\\nThe location is very central to shopping along Kalakaua and near to Ala Moana Center.  There is a great restaurant across the street called Cheeseburger Waikiki- we managed to hit both happy hours at 3pm and 9pm and had amazing service from Roman. There is also a smart car rental downstairs for $89/day (we didn't do it tho) and there is a 7/11 and ABC Mart downstairs also. So lots to do and many conveniences in the immediate building area.  Also a cute breakfast restaurant and some other sushi spots, etc... \\n\\nAs for the space- her photos are true and accurate.  It is a good size, comparable to a hotel room.  My husband and I had plenty of room for our luggage and we were very comfortable. The space is clean and decorated with modern comforts.  There is a small fridge so if you are on an extended stay you could fit groceries. She also provides 2 bottles of water as a welcome.  I noticed a kettle, coffee maker, hot plate and some dishes. There is a microwave and toaster oven.  The bathroom is open concept (no door) so if you are traveling with someone, be sure you are comfortable with them! I loved the design.  There is an armoire for clothing and beach/pool towels and bath towels provided as well as extra blanket/linen.  There is also soap/shampoo/conditioner. The unit is run by a window AC unit.  Because of all the windows, it was quite warm during the day.  We opted to open the windows and the warm breeze felt amazing.  The bed is also very comfortable-- it is a real bed (not a futon or pull out).  There is also secure wifi.\\n\\nThe unit is within a hotel/condo high rise.  Laundry is available on the 5th floor but it is $$ and operates on c/c ($3.75/wash and $2.75/dry)\\nThe pool and hot tub is lovely and there are BBQs available too.  Everyone in the building is super friendly.  The elevators are a bit slow but it seems to be a bit of an older building.  I noticed a fitness room and it seems things are slowly but surely being updated throughout the building. \\nDon't be put off by the green walls of the building hallway or some of the smells. You get used to it and the unit is just such a gem! It is also super secure- we noticed security cameras everywhere, a key is needed to access the elevator and there is onsite security.  It's great to feel so safe. We loved it and would love to stay again! \\n\\nThank you for a wonderful stay Dana, for being so easy to communicate with and for being so accommodating :)\"},\n",

The location is very convenient, walking distance to the conference center, the mall, the beach, etc.  There's 24 hr security and a 7-11 as well as convenience stores just outside.  You can rent cars in the lobby.  The unit looks just like the pictures and is totally adorable.  As others have pointed out, there is no door for the toilet so make sure you're okay with that if you are staying with another person.  If you're showering at night, you may want to do it with the lights off (do-able) because there are gaps in the curtains and the windows are not reflective from the outside.  Keep the windows closed when you're out and about because the room can become rather warm in the afternoons (there's a window AC unit).  \\r\\n\\r\\nDana was very accessible, friendly, and helpful and I would gladly work with her again.\"},\n",

The building the studio is in is a bit old And outdated, but the 24 hour security was very nice to have. It is about a 20 min walk to Waikiki beach and about a ten dollar cab ride.

As other reviews have said there is no real door to the bathroom just a dividing wall so be comfortable with who you are staying with. There's a pool & hot tub in the building, very nice.

Dana was very flexible with us about our arrival time (we were flying in that day) and met us right in front of the building with only about 15 minutes' notice as we were arriving from the hotel. This place is nicer than any of the hotels in the area would be, much more personable and more affordable, plus you're basically in a hotel building so you have access to great amenities such as the pool deck. Dana was very attentive and responsive throughout the reservation process, on arrival day, and when we checked out. Couldn't have been easier. I would recommend this as a great jumping-off point to explore Waikiki and Pearl Harbor (PH is not walking distance, but there is public transportation, Uber, taxis, etc. for pretty cheap).

Regardless it was like this at most hotels. The a/c blew cold and the room has everything we needed. The location was a 15min walk/7min drive to Waikiki beach and less than 10min to the mall.

Die kleine Wohnung/Zimmer war perfekt ausgestattet und liebevoll eingerichtet.\\r\\nDie Lage war toll und man konnte die Fußgängerzone und den Waikiki Strand super zu Fuß erreichen. Swimmingpool ist in dem Gebäude auch vorhanden. Die Kommunikation hat wirklich ganz toll mit Dana geklappt. Eine kleine Kritik habe ich, aber das betrifft eher das Gebäude. Das Hotel ist schon recht alt, daher auch die Fenster und man merkt es vor allem nachts, da wird es etwas lauter. Die Wohnung macht es aber auf jeden Fall wieder wett. Vielen Dank Dana!'},\n",

It was super cute with a great view, very clean, and well laid out for the size of the space. The bed was also incredibly comfortable!\\n\\nThe check in process was easy and painless, and the security office allowed us to store our bags with them for a small fee. This was really convenient for us, as we landed early in the morning.\\n\\nThe building is a quick walk from all the restaurants and attractions in Waikiki and there is plenty to do within a 10 minute walking radius. We enjoyed our stay in Dana's studio and recommend it for a trip to Waikiki. \"},\n",

It’s minutes from the beach and a short walk to Waikiki or Ft DeRussy beach, or easy bus ride to further sights (e.g., Iolani Palace, Diamonds Head).  As a bachelor suite, the room itself was the perfect size for a couple looking to explore Honolulu. Inside, the décor is pretty and modern and makes a nice private place to relax after a long day of adventure.  Though we didn't get a chance to use the pool (we were too busy exploring Honolulu), it looked well maintained and like a great place to relax.  Outside, the building itself, which is both a hotel and condo buildling, is a bit dated. However, the staff are very friendly, and someone is always around – night or day - to help you in case your key card doesn’t work.  Dana was also a great host, and communication with her was quick and easy!   \"},\n",

       "   'comments': 'Der Check-in war sehr einfach. Das Gebäude ist recht groß sowie bekannt, also für Bus und Taxi kein Problem. Es sind ca. 5 min zum Strand (Hilton Hotel). Zur Shopping Meile sowie zum Waikiki Beach dauert es ca. 10min. Direkt gegenüber ist ein ABC-Store sowie ein 7Eleven. Sehr zu empfehlen ist die kleine süße Bäckerei, die direkt an dem Gebäude im 1. Stock leckere Dinge zaubert. Das Zimmer besteht aus einem großen Raum, Badezimmer ist darin, ohne Türe enthalten. Überall sind Fenster und Spiegel, was dem Raum groß wirken lässt und sehr freundlich.\\nAllgemeine Tipps für Honolulu:\\n-Mietet euch ein Auto, ganz günstig über Expedia und fahrt mit dem zum North Shore hoch. Man kann zwar auch mit dem Bus fahren (Tagesticket 5 Dollar), aber das dauert sehr lange und man weiß eig nie wann genau der nächste Bus kommt. Allgemein sind im Bus Minusgrade. \\n-Den Dimond Head kann man nicht immer besteigen, wir konnten leider nicht den Trail hoch, da dieser nur am SA und SO auf war, was sehr ärgerlich war. \\n-Auch bei Pearl Harbor ist es von Vorteil, wenn man ein Auto hat, da dies außerhalb der Stadt liegt. Es gibt auch Ausflüge die einen Transfer haben, aber dies muss man rechtzeitig buchen.'},\n",

We locked the key in the letterbox downstairs when we left and Dana said it went missing and then tried to charge us $20 US. She was then very rude in demanding the money. We had a lot of problems with swipe key and had to have security change the key twice as it wasn’t working in the lifts or front door.

One con but is not Dana’s fault. The neighbors slam their doors at night and it woke up us during the night so it’s best to wear ear plugs at night for minimal noise disturbance. Oh and the bed is a Full bed so it might be too small for a larger couple. Maybe Dana can think about investing in a queen size bed.... that would be awesome :)\\nAll in all it was a very cute unit and we were satisfied with it. Mahalo Dana :)\\n-Annie and Andrew'},\n",

The location is great and is within walking distance (approximately 1 mile) from Ala Moana as well as other shopping centers, restaurants, and lots of tourist destinations, and within this particular room, the panoramic view is amazing. We particularly loved the Maleko Bakery downstairs on the same floor as the lobby. The owner bakes homemade pastries for the morning and makes pizza at night -- though we only tried the breakfast offerings namely the delicious scones, muffin, and drip coffee.\\n\\nIf you want to venture outside of Waikiki towards areas like East Oahu and the North Shore you should definitely rent a car. Our friend who also stayed in the Monarch paid $75 for 3 days of parking with in/ out privileges.\\n\\nOne thing to keep in mind is that while Dana's condo is newly renovated and stylish, the entire building is much older.\"},\n",

It\\'s a great place to stay if you\\'re looking to hang out in the area without having to walk too far to anything. The studio was the perfect size for my friend and I (2 small asian girls) and we had plenty of space for our luggage and to move around. The bedding was super comfortable, the air conditioning made the room very pleasantly cool and the bathroom shower was nice and hot. Not much else you can ask for really! The only thing, which Dana does make very clear, is that parking is a challenge (as it is everywhere in Waikiki). Free parking is not available in the building so you\\'ve got to go hunt for it on the main road (which is very difficult) or you pay a \"discounted\" rate of 25 USD a day to the building if you show them the keycard.'}]}"

On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport.

I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\\r\\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\\r\\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would totally stay here again.  \"},\n",

I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom!

Birds singing in the trees outside, comfy beds, loads of restaurants and grocery nearby. Lovely easy walks to Central Park, Riverside Park. Subway stop right on the corner. We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. \"},\n",

O bairro do Catete tem uma localização boa, conseguimos ir para a Lapa à pé e também para outros lugares como o aterro e a praia do Flamengo durante o carnaval. A estação de metrô também é perto e tem várias opções de alimentação muito próximas à casa. O layout da casa assemelha-se à um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferença com o calor que está no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que são suficientes para o número de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei lá, o banheiro não foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os hóspedes estavam mantendo-o em condições de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \\r\\nOutro ponto importante é que os quartos são ligados por uma porta que não tem fechadura e é bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade não é garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\\r\\nO preço é justo pelo que é oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se é possível fechar a comunicação dos quartos.'}]}"

O bairro do Catete tem uma localização boa, conseguimos ir para a Lapa à pé e também para outros lugares como o aterro e a praia do Flamengo durante o carnaval. A estação de metrô também é perto e tem várias opções de alimentação muito próximas à casa. O layout da casa assemelha-se à um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferença com o calor que está no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que são suficientes para o número de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei lá, o banheiro não foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os hóspedes estavam mantendo-o em condições de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \\r\\nOutro ponto importante é que os quartos são ligados por uma porta que não tem fechadura e é bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade não é garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\\r\\nO preço é justo pelo que é oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se é possível fechar a comunicação dos quartos.'}]}"

You can't get any better than that.  The apartment has all the conveniences of a home - everything you'd need in a kitchen, extremely comfortable mattress, cable TV, air conditioning, wifi, great water pressure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGreata goes way out of her way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.

There is a subway on the same street as the apartment, a two minute walk away (the 1 line) and multiple places to eat close by. There is also a CVS , Walgreens, grocery and liquor store within walking distance as well. The apartment is very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Checking in and out as easy as Greta is very flexible. The apartment is very spacious with a nice kitchen and lots of room in the fridge.

Again, great location (1 min walk from the subway), and we even managed to find free parking around! The place is really cozy and it's starting to feel like our 2nd home in NYC. Good shower, kitchen, separate bedrooms and a nice neighborhood close to central park. What more can you need? Highly recommended!\"},\n",

The apartment is near of Central Park and a lot of stores and restaurants. It’s a calm local neighborhood, to live your days in the city like a real new yorker :) . The place was very clean, the shower was good and beds was confortable. The heater sistem worked very well and kept us warm always - it was very important, because the temperatures was very low during our stay there. We definetelly recomend this place to stay! '},\n",

O bairro do Catete tem uma localização boa, conseguimos ir para a Lapa à pé e também para outros lugares como o aterro e a praia do Flamengo durante o carnaval. A estação de metrô também é perto e tem várias opções de alimentação muito próximas à casa. O layout da casa assemelha-se à um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferença com o calor que está no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que são suficientes para o número de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei lá, o banheiro não foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os hóspedes estavam mantendo-o em condições de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \\r\\nOutro ponto importante é que os quartos são ligados por uma porta que não tem fechadura e é bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade não é garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\\r\\nO preço é justo pelo que é oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se é possível fechar a comunicação dos quartos.'}]}"

The Murphy bed was comfortable, and the AC unit (not pictured) kept it nice and cool.  \\r\\nAlthough I didn't meet her, she arranged for a neighbor to meet me and show me in. He was cool and so were any other neighbors that I met. \\r\\nShe also left a list of suggestions where to shop and eat, along with menus which was helpful when I needed a late night meal. \\r\\nHighly recommended. \\r\\n\"},\n",

On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport.

Greta always replied immediately in the outmost helpful way during preparation and stay. thank you Greta! we will hopefully be back soon :)\\n'},\n",

The subway entrance close to the apartment was manned and easy to buy and top up your pass, it is the only way to travel around the city. On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport. Once again Greta allowed us to arrive and leave at times that suited us with our luggage which didn't leave us stranded for hours with difficult flight times from Australia which was a great relief, thanks so much Greta!\"},\n",

We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. \"},\n",

       "   'comments': \"Staying at Greta's apartment was delightful!  It's a wonderful, quirky New York apartment -- very compact, but also very comfy and accurately portrayed in the pictures.  The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!\"},\n",

I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\\r\\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\\r\\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would totally stay here again.  \"},\n",

Birds singing in the trees outside, comfy beds, loads of restaurants and grocery nearby. Lovely easy walks to Central Park, Riverside Park. Subway stop right on the corner. We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. \"},\n",
